30 September 2016 Government encourages citizens to continuosly showcase their diverse African culture and heritage As we close Heritage Month, government wishes to applaud all South Africans for celebrating their African identity and unique cultures. The 2016 Heritage Month campaign themed “Celebrating our Human Treasures by Asserting our African Identity”, afforded all people an opportunity to reconnect with their unique cultural history and pride in being African. In his remarks at the 2016 National Heritage Day celebration in Kimberley in the Northern Cape on 24 September, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa encouraged all citizens to play their part in ensuring that South Africa’s young people were nurtured in the ancient wisdom of the country’s rich cultural history. He urged communities to reflect on ‘who we are’ and ‘where we come from’, reminding us that we need to work tirelessly to forge a common future founded on equality, compassion and social justice. During Heritage Month, government hosted dialogues, indigenous games and public lectures to educate and exchange knowledge and understanding on the significant role of heritage in bridging divisions and fostering social cohesion. Notable projects launched during September included the Heritage in Schools and Capacity-Building programme aimed at reinforcing interventions that promote nation-building and social cohesion among learners. The programme focuses on developing heritage literacy using different art forms to teach young learners about national identity. GCIS Acting Director-General, Mr Donald Liphoko, said, “Every South African citizen has a responsibility to promote our rich culture and build a unified nation. While Heritage Month comes to an end, celebrations of our heritage should continue to be the foundation for all citizens to take pride in being African”.
