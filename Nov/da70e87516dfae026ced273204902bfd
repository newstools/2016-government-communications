11 November 2016 South Africans to rally behind national teams ahead of super Saturday South Africans can expect a bumper line-up of national sporting events tomorrow as the Springboks, Proteas and Bafana Bafana, tackle their opponents head on. Tomorrow, the Springboks will play against England at Twickenham; Bafana Bafana will go head to head with Senegal in a World-Cup qualifier match in Polokwane; and the Proteas will take on Australia in the second Test in Hobart. Government encourages citizens to rally behind the national teams and maintain a positive hype towards the build-up of super Saturday. “We call on South Africans to once again unite behind our national teams by watching the various matches and wearing the colours of South Africa's flag or the shirt of their favourite team. Let us embrace and capture the sense of our national pride as our teams fly the country’s flag high.” Sports play a fundamental role in promoting nation building, social cohesion, and a healthy lifestyle. “It has the ability to bring people together and positively contribute to many of the factors which assists in building social cohesion, such as better physical and mental health, unemployment amongst others. Sport has the power to unite people across race, gender, culture and social status and this builds our country’s social fabric.” added Liphoko. Liphoko said; “an active nation is achievable through the participation of communities. Citizens are encouraged to use the power of social media to send messages of support and encourage our national teams. Let us as a nation utilise the ability of sports and move South Africa forward.” Enquiries:Donald LiphokoCell: 082 901 0766E-mail: donaldl@gcis.gov.za Issued by Government Communication and Information System (GCIS)
