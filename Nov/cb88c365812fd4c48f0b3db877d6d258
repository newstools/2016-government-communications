10 November 2016 Government is deeply saddened and sends condolences to the family and friends of people who were killed in incidents resulting from yesterday’s heavy rains and floods. The downpour that battered some parts of the Gauteng province left a trail of destruction, as reported in the media, with many cars being swept away in the floods and some homes being flooded. “Our thoughts are with the families of the victims and those that were injured and affected by the storm. It is sad and unfortunate that a child went missing yesterday during the floods. The police are hard at work to find the child. We also empathise with those that have lost their properties and belongings during this time. The Gauteng provincial government has activated the disaster management centre to coordinate investigations into the extent of damage caused by the flash floods,” said Donald Liphoko, GCIS Director-General. The SA Weather Service has issued an alert for severe thunderstorms in Gauteng today. Community members are advised to avoid crossing low lying bridges, streams and rivers; and encouraged motorists to exercise caution and avoid driving on flooded areas. Motorists are advised to pay attention to barricades and to not drive through standing water on roads or in parking lots. During heavy rains motorists must be on special alert near dips in the highway and near low-lying bridges. Parents are also advised to keep children away from playing in and near drainage ditches and storm water drains. In the event of an emergency, residents of Gauteng should call the emergency management services on 10177. Weather SA has urged the public to regularly follow weather forecasts on television and radio.
